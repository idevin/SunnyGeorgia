        <p>You can understand what Georgia is from an old but wise legend.</p>
        <p class="italic quote">
        <strong>‘‘</strong>Long, long ago, God decided to distribute land among nations. 
        It turned out that the Georgians had failed to come on time for the distribution. 
        When they appeared before God and began to ask the land for their people, God asked for an explanation of the reason for their being late. 
        It turned out that the Georgians had decided to make a stop on the way to celebrate the creation of the world. 
        During the festival, they proclaimed toasts, praising the Almighty. 
        This explanation was after God\'s heart, so He rewarded them with a piece of paradise He had meant to keep for Himself.
